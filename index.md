Hi, I'm Shuqing Luo. I'm an incoming CS PhD student in the UNITES lab at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, working with [Prof. Tianlong Chen](https://tianlong-chen.github.io/). I'm interested in efficient and distributed training and inference of large language models using algorithm-system co-design, such as structural & unstructural sparsity and advanced model parallelism.
